in Artificial intelligence we use languages like python, java, R etc
Python is most favourite language of AI Developers. python is interprate base and general purpose language.

model----> ML-----> 

we can train models according to our requirement and we can also use already trained models. but those models couldnot be so 
accurate because the are trained on any other type of data, which could be far differ from your one.

Accuracy Problem:
	1: Data Could be Corrupt.
	2: Model is not trained Well.
	3: Model cannot work with selected data (incompatible).

Paths:
	1: Relative (name.exe)			2: Absolute (C:/programs/name.exe)

Basic Steps in ML:
	
	Import Basic libraries.
	Read Dataset.
	Preprocess Dataset.
	Distribute your dataset into dependent and independent variables.
	Splitup your dataset into training and testing 
	Choose Model
	Train Model
	Test Model
	Eveluate Model
